I am also interested in using analytical tools to solve operations problems from production, logistics, supply chain management, service operations and healthcare operations etc. My research in this area typically uses stochastic models and statistics to obtain interesting managerial insights or to solve complicated decision-making problems. Here is a list of publications and preprints that I have in this area.

Recently, my groupâ€™s research interests in this area include both data-driven/empirical works with applications to service operations, healthcare operations as well as revenue management.
